# Fuzzy-Logic-Weather-Classification
This project develops an application that aims to explain the weather using fuzzy logic. According to the temperature and humidity values ​​received from the user, the weather is divided into categories such as 'cold', 'hot', 'humid'. This project analyzes the perceived temperature using main logic and defuzzification methods.
